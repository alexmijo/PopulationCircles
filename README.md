Finding the population of circles on earth
This program, among other things, can beat the previous best known results for finding the smallest possible circles on earth containing a given percentage of the
worldâ€™s population. Also wrote code in C++, Python and Java to render the maps.
This software is what I used to make these maps:

A much earlier version of this software (even earlier than the first commit of this project on github) is what I used to make these maps (and it wouldn't take much
modification to add this functionality back in):
