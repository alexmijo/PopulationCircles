# PopulationCircles
Note to any potential employers: This code kinda got spaghettified and I haven't yet brought it up to my normal standards for code quality (although it does still work well). If you'd like to see a better example of clean C++ code I've written, look at https://github.com/alexmijo/BlackjackSim Edit: Nvm that's really old, dang that has a ton of unneeded comments lol

This program can, among other things, find the smallest possible circles on earth containing a given percentage of the
worldâ€™s population. Also wrote code in C++, Python and Java to render the maps.
This software is what I used to make these maps:

A much earlier version of this software (even earlier than the first commit of this project on github) is what I used to make these maps (and it wouldn't take much
modification to add this functionality back in):

Here's some more info on the code and how it was able to be relatively fast, copied from a reddit comment I made in one of the above links:

See this Wikipedia page for prior work on the 50% population circle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeriepieris_circle

The original viral map (the first image on that Wikipedia page) was cool but it almost kinda annoyed me when I saw it on reddit several years ago since they didn't account for the distortion of the map projection (it looked like a circle on that image but wouldn't look like a circle on a globe) and I didn't know if that was the smallest that they could've made that circle. A Singaporean professor named Danny Quah apparently also had the same thoughts, and he found a circle (that would actually be a circle on a globe) of radius 3300km instead of ~4000km like in the original image; that's the second image on that wikipedia page. I achieved a better result than Quah for the 50% circle (3281km instead of 3300km) since I analyzed the population data at a <1km resolution instead of 100km resolution like he did (I'd guess we actually used the same population data since he also used 2015 data and there aren't many competing datasets for this sort of stuff). I was able to do this without the code taking 10,000 to 100,000,000 times longer (1002 to 1004 , depending on what exactly it means to be analyzing the data at a 100km resolution) by using this technique https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed-area_table and generating a single circular kernel for each latitude. Even with this considerable speedup, the population data was so high resolution (much higher resolution than this image) that I had to run the program overnight. I find it interesting that unlike both the original circle and Quah's circle, my 50% circle doesn't include any of the island of Java (it's better to be further north to get more of northeastern China, Korea and Japan it seems).

This is a description of the algorithm used, copied from this https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/x9iio0/the_smallest_possible_circles_containing_1100_of/inozpie/ reddit comment:

Essentially it splits circles up into rectangles (I called this collection of rectangles - stored as offsets of their 4 corners from the center of the circle - a "kernel"), uses a summed area table to quickly sum up the pixels inside circles, and reuses kernels as much as possible (they'll be the same for the same radius and latitude) since constructing them is the only thing that requires calculating distance. So that's how it quickly gets the population inside of a circle.

To find the most populous circle of a given radius, it scans across the whole world at increasingly fine step sizes, using the results of the previous scan to narrow the search area. I think basin hopping maybe could've been used here too and been faster but idk, I don't really understand the difference between that and stochastic gradient descent anyways. This step is what could cause it to get the wrong answer (especially on an adversarial input), but I sort of tuned parameters such that I was convinced that the chance of that happening at all was really small. And if it did happen, the circle would very likely only be off by a couple of kilometers.

And since it can relatively quickly find the most populous circle of a given radius, I just find the smallest circle of a given population with a binary search over radiuses.

It also "short-circuits" (just what I called it in the code), where it can find upper bounds for the binary search without as exhaustive a search over the earth as it does for lower bounds (since it can just stop once it finds any circle that's too populous, even if it's not the most populous possible of that radius).
